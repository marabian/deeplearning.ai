    "This is all under active research, and there have been some discoveries such as chain-of-thought promoting as people continue experimenting. The developers themselves don't completely understand how ChatGPT interprets and generates responses. That is, at a fundamental level they understand what they've built and how it works in small pieces, but at the more abstract high level, such as how ChatGPT has internally organized or mapped its ocean of knowledge, and what it's capable of with the right prompting, is still unclear. That's one reason this is such an exciting piece of technology. - Vafostin_Romchool"

E.g. may have contractors help you write a lot of (example of an instruction, a good response to an instruction) samples. This creates a training set for the fine-tuning. It learns to **what is the next word if it's trying to follow an instruction.\n",

A common process is to obtain **human ratings** on the quality of many different LLM outputs on criteria (e.g. helpful, honest, harmless). Can then further fine-tune the LLM to increase the probability of it generating the more highly rated output. Most common technique to do is **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback). Going from base LLM to instruction tuned LLM can be done in days on a much more modest dataset with much more modest computational resources.\n",

Including the instruction in the training helps the model discern these nuances.\n",

It allows the model to continue learning in the same way it was initially trained, but with a focus on specific types of inputs and outputs.\n",

It learns to apply this understanding in a targeted way to respond to specific types of queries.\n",

    "* Let's explain why with 2 analogies comparing **chain-of-thought reasoning** and **chaining multiple prompts**:\n",
    "    * 1. Cooking a complex meal in one go vs cooking it in stages. Using one long instruction is like trying to cook a complex meal all at once, while trying to manage multiple ingredients, cooking techniques, and timings simultaneously. Can be challenging to keep track of everything and ensure each component is cooked perfectly. **Chaining prompts** on the other hand is like cooking the meal in stages, focusing on one component at a time, ensuring each part is cooked correctly before movin onto the next. Breaks down the complexity of the task, making it easier to manage and reducing the likelihood of errors. However, it is more focused and might be unnecessary and complicated for a very simple recipe.\n",
    "<br><br><br>\n",
    "     * 2. Reading spaghetti code with everything in one long file vs simler modular program. Spaghetti code can be ambigious and have complex dependencies between different parts of the logic. The same can be true of a complex single step task submitted to an LLM. **Chaining prompts** is powerful when you have a workflow where you can maintain the state of the system at any given point, and take different actions depending on that state. For example, after classifying an incoming customer query, current state might be the classification \"It's a product question\". Based on the state, might do something different. **Each subtask** contains only the instructions required for a single state of the task, which makes the system easier to manage, makes sure the model has all the info it needs to carry out a task, and and reduces likelihood of errors. Can also reduce lower cost, longer prompts=more money.\n",
    "      \n",
    "* **Benefit**: Also easier to test which steps failing more often\n",
    "* **Benefit**: Have human in the loop at a specific step\n",
    "* **Benefit**: Allows the model to **use external tools** at certain points of the workflow if necessary. E.g. might decide to look something up in a product catalogue, or call an API, or seach a knowledge base. Something that could not be achieve by a single prompt.\n",
    "* **Summary**: Instead of describing a whole complex workflow in dozens of bullet points/paragraphs in one prompt, might be better to keep track of the state externally, and then inject relevant instructions as needed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **What makes a problem complex?**: If there are many different instructions and potentially all of them could apply to any given situation, as these are the cases where it can become hard for the model to reason about what to do. You will gain an intuition on when to use this strategy vs the previous."

    "\n",
    "1. Tune prompt on small handful of examples (1,3,5). Try to get a prompt that works on them.\n",
    "2. Add additional \"tricky\" examples opportunistically. Add these tricky examples and add them to the set you are testing on.\n",
    "3. Eventually have enough examples develop metrics to measure performance (e.g. average accuracy), since it becomes tedious to manually run each prompt/evaluate manually. If you decide system is working well, can step right there and not go on to the next bullet (many apps start in the first or second bullet and run just fine).\n",
    "4. If your hand built development set you are evaluating model on isn't giving you sufficient confidence yet in the performance of the system, then randomly sample set of examples to tune the models (development set/hold-out cross validation). Can be common to continue to tune your prompt to this.\n",
    "THIS STEP IS IMPORTANT IF SYSTEM IS GETTING RIGHT ANSWER 91% of the time, want to tune to get 92 or 93 percent right answer. Need a larger set of examples to measure those differences (91 vs 93 performance). Only if you really need an unbiased, fair estimate of how well the system is doing, you go beyond the development set to also collect a hold-out test set.\n",
    "6. Only if you need higher fidelity estimate of the performance of your system then you can collect and use a hold-out test set that you don't even look at yourself when tuning the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caveat**: For high stake apps, if risk of bias/inappropriate output can cause harm to someone, then responsibility to collect a test set to rigorously evaluate the performance of the system falls on you the developer. Make sure it is doing the right thing!!! But if using to summarize articles for yourself to read, risk of harm is more modest, can stop early in this process without going thru the expense of going thru steps 4, 5 which is costly."
